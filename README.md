# Project Euler + Ruby + TDD

These are my attempts to solve the [Project Euler](projecteuler.net) problems using TDD and Ruby.

The tricky part about using TDD to solve the problems is that I have to know the answer to build the test...so, I have been looking up the answers prior to beginning to solve the problem.

While this might sound like I am defeating the purpose of even attempting solving the problems, my ultimate goal is to further develop my use of TDD and find new and unique ways to solve problems with Ruby.
